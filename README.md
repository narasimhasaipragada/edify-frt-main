# Future Ready Telent Project

# Industry Name : Ed-tech

# Project Title : Edify

# Problem Statement :

1. The reason for creating this edify chatbot is to help students to contact the training institute in a better way so as they can get response in no time. Contacting training institute through mobile or phone requires much time and man power last but no least there will be huge traffic for communication to occur between students and institute. To work all round the clock human power is required to answer basic questions through mobile so automating the communication process through chatbot we can reduce both man power and time for gathering information.

2. Students sometimes don’t always know where to find the information that they need. Edify chatbot can help to better rout the intention of the user and help to take decisions wisely.The first task that a chatbot performs is that it analyzes the user’s request to identify the user intent and to extract relevant entities.Once the user intention is identified the chatbot must provide the most appropriate response for the user’s request.
